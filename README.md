## Description
Brief description of the project

*Bella's adventures* is a game where you'll be able to see the world through Bella's eyes. Bella is the cutest Jack Russell you'll ever encounter and in this adventure, she'll be on her way to the beach, where her human-parents are waiting for her. She has lots of energy but it's a long way, so she'll need to preserve that energy in order to get to her final destination. Running into bushes take part of her energy away but meeting with other dogs make her run out of energy straight away (she can't control herself and wants to play aaaall daaaay :sweat_smile: ).

## MVP
List of min features

- Bella is able to move vertically, yet not horizontally
- Bushes and doggies appear randomly horizontally
- Bella will start the game with 100% energy
- If Bella runs into bushes, her energy level will drop partially
- If Bella runs into doggies, her energy level, no matter where it is, will drop completely. This will make the player lose the game
